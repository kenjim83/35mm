Kunihiko Tomioka was a frequent visitor to the club\u2019s screenings before he moved to Tokyo to pursue a career as screenplay writer.<br \/>\nIn Tokyo, Tomioka wrote screenplays for various films, Kiyoshi Kurosawa\u2019s The Guard from Underground (1992), is probably the best known film he penned.<br \/>\nUpon his return to Osaka, Tomioka got in contact with Yasui again whose Planet Studyo film club had since long ceased operating. Yasui told him about an available space in the basement of the same building in Osaka Doyama-cho in which Yasui had his office and in which he stored his film collection.<br \/>\nIt was in this little basement space that Tomioka opened his first theater in 1995, named Planet Studyo +1 in honor of Yasui\u2019s film club. The theater screened films on both 35mm and 16mm even though it had hardly space enough for 20 seats. <\/p>\n<p>In 1997, Tomioka was approached by a young director whose graduation film for the Osaka University of Arts (Osaka Geidai) was too scandalous and no theater in the city wanted to show it. The director was Kazuyoshi Kumakiri and the film was Kichiku Dai Enkai (released as Kichiku in foreign markets). Kumakiri brought Tomioka in contact with a group of young directors working towards their degree at the Osaka University of Arts. Tomioka had a 16mm Steenbeck editing table at his home \u2013 and thus his apartment suddenly became the center of an emerging scene of young directors camping out at Tomioka\u2019s house, working on the editing table and turning the apartment into a zone of endless parties. Several directors emerged from that scene who later achieved international acclaim, most notably Nobuhiro Yamashita (Hazy Life, 1999) and Go Shibata (Late Bloomer, 2005). <\/p>\n<p>In 2005 Tomioka moved the Planet Studyo +1 theater to its current location in Osaka Nakazaki-cho. The new location offers a caf\u00e9 on the ground floor (operated independently from the Planet theater), the theater itself is on the second floor and a gallery room used by the Planet theater for meetings, seminars and the like on the third floor. Unfortunately, rooftop screenings had to be abandoned due to noise complaints by neighbors.<\/p>\n<p>Tomioka is still very actively working with the young and upcoming filmmakers of Osaka. He features their work in an ambitious annual festival called Co2 (Cineaste Organization Osaka), held in larger theaters in Osaka, and he is also deeply involved in producing, funding and creating new works by young directors.<br \/>\nYoshio Yasui has by now moved his film collection to Kobe. Known under the name Planet Film Document Archives, the collection has grown into one of the biggest privately held film archives in Japan. Yasui and Tomioka jointly operate the Planet Film Document Archives, the Planet Studyo +1 theater often screens prints from the archives vast collection of both Japanese and international films. <\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s program schedule at the Planet Studyo +1 theater consists to a large part of classic Japanese and Hollywood films from the archives (projected on 35mm or 16mm) as well as a wild assortment of the weird, the strange and the underground from both Japan and elsewhere. In terms of American films, on the screen of the Planet you are just as likely to encounter Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum as, god forbid, Jamie Gillis.

The cinema kept its name Kino Sloga (the Sloga Cinema) until the beginning of the 1990s, when it was renamed Kino Dvor (the Dvor Cinema). During the final decade before the name change, the Sloga Cinema screened erotic and pornographic films.<\/p>\n<p>After many single-screen cinemas closed down due to the opening of multiplexes in Slovenia, the Slovenian Cinematheque, the Municipality of Ljubljana, and the Slovene Ministry of Culture joined efforts to bring film culture back to the city centre by renovating and launching Kinodvor as one of the first exclusive art house cinemas in the country.<\/p>\n<p>Since October 2008 Kinodvor\u2019s program policy is embodied by its orientation towards a new type of cinema called \u201cevent cinema,\u201d where the focus is on the cinema-going experience enriched with special events.

With a dark blue ceiling, \u201ctwinkling stars\u201d and moving cloud formations suggesting a night sky, and walls and towers suggesting an Italian courtyard, patrons are made to feel as if they are watching a film in an open-air Tuscan palazzo. The Music Box opened on August 22, 1929, a time when the movie palaces in downtown Chicago each had seating capacities of around 3,000 people. The Music Box, which sat 800, was considered an elaborate little brother to those theatres. Theatre Architecture magazine noted in 1929 that the theatre \u201crepresents the smaller, though charming and well equipped, sound picture theatre which is rapidly taking the place of the \u2018deluxe\u2019 palace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As Chicago Tribune architectural critic Paul Gapp wrote (Arts and Books, July 31, 1983), The architectural style is an eclectic melange of Italian, Spanish and Pardon-My-Fantasy put together with passion. The actual style is called \u201catmospheric\u201d. The dark blue, cove-lit ceiling with \u201ctwinkling stars\u201d and moving cloud formations suggests a night sky. The plaster ornamentation of the side walls, round towers, faux-marble loggia and ogee-arched organ chambers are, by Hollywood standards, reminiscent of the walls surrounding an Italian courtyard. Overall the effect is to make the patron feel that they are watching a film in an open air palazzo.<\/p>\n<p>In 1983 management reopened the theater with a format of double feature revival and repertory films. Eventually, foreign films were reinstated, and independent and cult films were added to the roster. The Music Box Theatre now presents a yearly average of 300 films.<\/p>\n<p>In 1991, management decided to add a second screen. Rather than split the main theater in two, a small theater was built in an existing storefront adjacent to the lobby. The ambiance of the theatre was designed to echo the architecture of the main auditorium. The feeling is still atmospheric but because of the 13-foot ceiling, the feel is that of sitting under a garden trellis with stars in the night sky beyond.<\/p>\n<p>For the last two decades, the Music Box Theatre has been the premiere venue in Chicago for independent and foreign films. It currently has the largest theater space operated full time in the city. The Music Box Theatre is independently owned and operated by the Southport Music Box Corporation. SMBC, through its Music Box Films division, also distributes foreign and independent films in the theatrical, DVD and television markets throughout the United States.<\/p>\n<p>3733 N Southport Ave<br \/>\nChicago, IL 60613<br \/>\n(773) 871-6607<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.musicboxtheatre.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Music Box Theatre<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/musicboxchicago\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook: Music Box Theatre<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Music Box Theatre retains its original architecture and design.

The theater had a seating capacity of about 650 downstairs and 250 in the balcony. For many years in the 1950s and 1960s the Hollywood Theater was one of Stanley Warner\u2019s main second-run neighborhood houses in Pittsburgh, and even enjoyed a spell as a first-run house in the late 1960s. The Hollywood played Warner, Universal, RKO, Disney, and United Artists films. The Harris South Hills, about a mile away, ran competing Fox, MGM, Columbia, and Paramount films (Note: The South Hills Theater was razed in 2010). The Hollywood Theater\u2019s original marquee, which contained thousands of bulbs and two glass attraction panels, was removed when the city widened the street and the glass tile facade was replaced with stucco.<\/p>\n<p>The advent of the VCR and Blockbuster video stores in the 1980s severely affected attendance at theaters, especially second-run movie house like the Hollywood. The theater eked along, but by the mid 1990s, the interior was showing signs of age and neglect. It  closed in 1998.<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, the Bradley Center, an agency serving children with mental, emotional, and developmental disabilities, signed a lease with the building\u2019s owner, Hollywood Partners, LLC, and renovated the theater. During the renovation process, seating was decreased to 300 to offer more leg space and a more comfortable viewing experience. When it reopened the following year, teens from the Bradley Center manned the theater to gain essential work experience. Unfortunately, the venture did not work and the theater closed in 2008. A group of mid-west investors were the next to give it a try, reopening the Hollywood in August 2009; it closed again in the spring of 2010.<\/p>\n<p>Enter the Friends of the Hollywood Theater, who reopened the theater in May 2011, and began a new chapter for this historic building\u2026<\/p>\n<p>1449 Potomac Ave<br \/>\nPittsburgh, PA 15216<br \/>\n(412) 563-0368<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehollywooddormont.org\/\">Hollywood Theater Dormont<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/HollywoodTheaterDormont\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook: Hollywood Theater Dormont<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Hollywood Theater opened around 1924 with bowling and billiards in the basement.

The opening program featured a music and dance act \u2013 The Stewart Sisters; a comedy playlet by the Fuller-Rose company called \u201cA King For A Day;\u201d a singing skit by the Adairs; and \u201cThe Inventor\u2019s Wife\u201d \u2013 a two-reel film presentation. <\/p>\n<p>In 2006 renovations restored the original auditorium interior to its original color scheme; and the stage was restored to its original size and upgraded with new curtains, rigging, and movie screen. In the summer of 2009, more renovations took place. The aging balcony was repaired and all new seating replaced the originals still there from 1914.  Dolby Digital Sound and 24 surround speakers were installed throughout the original auditorium.  And a revamped projection booth containing two Norelco DP-70 projectors was installed, enabling the Somerville to be one of the few movie theatres in New England that can run 70mm film.<\/p>\n<p>The primary cinemas show 35mm film or DCP Cinema. Cinema 1 seats 900, Cinema 2 seats 94, Cinema 3 seats 150, Cinema 4 seats 92, and Cinema 5 seats 140.<\/p>\n<p>The main theater seats 399 on the orchestra level and the balance of 500 seats in the balcony. The stage is approximately 41\u2032 wide and 22\u2032 deep, with a 32\u2032 wide proscenium. The main theater can show archival film prints in both 35mm and 70mm formats on a pair of beautifully maintained Norelco DP-70 projectors, and features Dolby 7.1 EX Digital Sound, with two subwoofers and 24 surround speakers throughout the auditorium for cinema presentations.<\/p>\n<p>55 Davis Square<br \/>\nSomerville, MA 02144<br \/>\n(617) 625-5700<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/somervilletheatre.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Somerville Theatre<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Somerville-Theatre-131940086662\/?hc_location=ufi\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook: Somerville Theatre<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Somerville Theatre, part of the Hobbs Building in the heart of Davis Square, was designed by the firm of Funk &#038; Wilcox of Boston and built in 1914 by Joseph Hobbs.

The Texas Theatre was the novelty of longtime Oak Cliff resident and entrepreneur, C. R. McHenry, better known in the community as \u201cUncle Mack.\u201d McHenry\u2019s dream was to build a theater with state-of-the-art projection and sound equipment.<\/p>\n<p>McHenry partnered with four Dallas-area businessmen to help him realize this dream. Together they hired renowned architect W. Scott Dunne to design the Texas. He opted for a \u201cVenetian\u201d style, quite similar to his earlier Texas Theater in San Angelo. The design included opera boxes in the auditorium under a full night sky, fountains, projected clouds on the ceiling, and of course a giant chandelier. The completed theatre was the largest \u201csuburban\u201d movie house and the third-largest theatre in Dallas.<\/p>\n<p>On November 22, 1963 at approximately 1:45 p.m., nearly 15 Dallas police officers converged on the Texas Theatre in search of a man who had entered without paying. That man was Lee Harvey Oswald\u2014murder suspect in the slaying of Officer J.D. Tippit and later President John F. Kennedy\u2019s accused lone assassin. He ducked into the theatre during an in-progress showing of War Is Hell and sat near the back of the auditorium. <\/p>\n<p>As technology in moving, talking, and color pictures progressed and drive-ins and multiplex cinema became the rave, the Texas Theatre\u2019s patrons slowly moved on to other entertainment venues. In 2001 The Oak Cliff Foundation purchased the building and began looking for a new permanent tenant. Several areas of the building were renovated and upgraded by the OCF. The Texas Theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.<\/p>\n<p>On August 31st, 2010, Aviation Cinemas Inc, a company formed by filmmaker and film industry consultant Barak Epstein took over the lease of the Texas Theatre. Epstein enlisted the help of filmmakers Adam Donaghey, Eric Steele and Jason Reimer to begin new cinema and event venue operations at the Texas Theatre.<\/p>\n<p>The Texas has both 16mm and 35mm capabilities, in addition to current video projection.<\/p>\n<p>231 West Jefferson Blvd<br \/>\nOak Cliff, TX 75208<br \/>\n214-948-1546<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetexastheatre.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Texas Theatre<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Photo \u00a9 Jason Reimer 2010 The Texas Theatre was opened at 231 West Jefferson Boulevard with fanfare on San Jacinto Day, April 21, 1931.

So it morphed from a marginal one-screen, second-run arthouse into a throwback repertory that might be described as a pocket-size mix of the Prince Charles and the old Scala Cinema, but with a more updated and community-based edge.

Its wild diversity of programming can be attributed to the open-minded Danish mentality, the absence of censorship and its own stubborn insistence not to be bound to any profile or brand.

The Dryden Theatre first welcomed the public on March 2, 1951, with special guest Lowell Thomas broadcasting coast-to-coast in a program that saluted George Eastman and the city of Rochester. The first feature film screening\u2014Jean Renoir&#8217;s Nana (1926)\u2014was held on March 14, marking the official opening. Since its curtain was raised in 1951, the Dryden Theatre has supported the growth of the museum&#8217;s moving image collection, provided a forum for discussion on the history of the medium, and screened more than 16,000 titles. The Dryden has hosted hundreds of cinema\u2019s most talented directors, cinematographers, actors, animators, critics, and others, serving as a meeting place for those who practice the art of making film and their audiences.<\/p>\n<p>The 500-seat Dryden Theatre is the premier exhibition space for the art of cinema as championed and interpreted by the George Eastman Museum. Presenting film screenings every day of the week, the Dryden is devoted to showing all films in their original formats, thus honoring and reproducing their historical\u2014and aesthetically supreme\u2014modes of exhibition. It is one of the very few theaters in the world equipped for the projection of original nitrate film that also makes nitrate film screenings part of its regular program.<\/p>\n<p>The projection booth is equipped with two reel-to-reel 35mm\/16mm Kinoton projectors and two 35mm Century projectors. Both sets of projectors have adaptable lenses for various aspect ratios. The Dryden is also equipped with a Barco Digital Cinema projector capable of projecting DCPs and a wide variety of other digital formats.<\/p>\n<p>The Dryden Theatre projection booth is customized to handle nitrate film. Discontinued in the mid-20th century due to its highly flammable nature, nitrate film stock\u2014the combination of a silver nitrate base and orthochromatic or panchromatic emulsion\u2014provided a shimmering, luminous motion picture experience for moviegoers during the decades of cinema. One of only a handful of venues in the world that is still safely equipped and certified to show 35mm nitrate prints, the Dryden Theatre is occasionally able to re-introduce audiences to this special kind of cinema magic with classic films from our vaults or other leading archives. Because no nitrate film stock is being produced today, these rare screenings of vintage prints may represent your only opportunity to experience this distinctive aesthetic visual pleasure. In 2015, the Eastman Museum held its inaugural festival celebrating the preservation and presentation of these rare prints: The Nitrate Picture Show, the world&#8217;s first festival of film conservation.<\/p>\n<p>900 East Avenue<br \/>\nRochester, NY 14607<br \/>\n585-271-3361<br \/>\ndryden@eastman.org<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/eastman.org\/dryden-theatre\" target=\"_blank\">Dryden Theatre<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Providing a proper venue to screen the museum&#8217;s film collection was of paramount importance to Oscar N.

The Little Cinema Movement, which was dedicated to showing &#8220;art films that appeal to the intelligent and sophisticated,&#8221; started in 1925. When it opened in 1929, The Little Theatre was the fifth &#8220;little temple of the cinema&#8221; to be built, and was constructed in the Art Deco style by Edgar Phillips of Rochester and Frederick Pike of Buffalo. The distinctive style of the original theatre, now Little Theatre 1, has earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places.   The Little Theatre officially opened October 17, 1929. A three-man orchestra seated in the upper rear left balcony provided accompaniment for the 299 persons attending. The Little Theatre was quickly nicknamed &#8220;The House of Silent Shadows&#8221; and its first presentation was the silent film &#8220;Cyrano de Bergerac.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Early literature describing The Little alludes to the physical layout, atmosphere, and programs as exuding elegance, refinement, intelligence, and repose as an antidote to the helter-skelter pace of the Roaring Twenties.  By early 1931, Albert A. Fenvyssey, considered Rochester&#8217;s leading theatrical expert, was approached to assist in establishing the theatre&#8217;s role in the local community. Fenvyssey persuaded the owners, Mr. and Mrs. Francis Kirk Remington, to turn the theatre over to his daughter, Florence Fenvyssey Belinson, and son-in-law Ben Belinson.   A tireless champion of The Little and cultural improvement, Florence Belinson promoted the theatre throughout the Rochester community, especially among women&#8217;s groups. In her many addresses, she affirmed The Little&#8217;s commitment to high social and cultural standards.<\/p>\n<p>Within two years of opening, The Little would reinvent itself, incorporating &#8220;talking films&#8221; into its repertoire. The Little&#8217;s first talking picture was &#8220;Outward Bound&#8221; featuring Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Helen Chandler and Leslie Howard. The film was previewed on April 15, 1931. Shortly thereafter, The Little took the bold step of showing a foreign language film. While common in larger cities, such films were rarely if ever shown in smaller communities like Rochester. The first to be shown at The Little was the German language film &#8220;Two Hearts in Waltz Time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So successful would The Little become that its reputation for quality attracted national recognition. One of The Little&#8217;s greatest coups occurred in 1949 when the theatre was chosen to premiere Olivier&#8217;s &#8220;Hamlet.&#8221; In words that recall the Theatre&#8217;s original mission, The Little drew praise from those who had selected the theatre as the premiere site. The Little earned selection because of its &#8220;Consistent policy of showing unusual motion pictures and its record for maintaining long runs of such films.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>In May 1982, William Coppard and John and Pam Blanpied bought The Little and undertook an ambitious restoration project.  The new owners reaffirmed the theatre\u2019s original commitment to film and sought to recreate an atmosphere keeping with the original design. Two additional screens were created in a tire store adjacent to the original East Avenue location.  <\/p>\n<p>In 1993, after consulting with the founders of the largest chain of art theatres in the United States, it was decided to expand again. Two more screens were finished in 1994 in a former collision shop next to Theaters 2 and 3. A caf\u00e9 was added in another building next to the new Theaters 4 and 5. Two years later, in 1996, Theaters 2 and 3 were given fresh seats and other upgrades. The resulting was a total of five theaters seating 940, all with stereo sound and comfortable seating, as well as a 70-seat caf\u00e9 featuring live jazz music, accented by a rotating gallery of local artists.<\/p>\n<p>The intimate atmosphere of its historic East Avenue location has now been a mainstay in Rochester&#8217;s East End for over 85 years.  While other theaters in the United States have continually closed and (sometimes) reopened, The Little screens have never gone dark. This makes it the oldest continuously running art-house film theatre in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The theater is dedicated to preserving its 35mm heritage, including installation of \u201creel to reel\u201d technology that permits exhibition of archival material, with 35mm film prints playable on 2 different screens.<\/p>\n<p>240 East Avenue<br \/>\nRochester, NY 14604<br \/>\n585-258-0400<br \/>\ninfo@thelittle.org<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/thelittle.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Little Theatre<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Little Theatre began construction in Rochester in 1928 as a link in a proposed chain of small theatres designed to provide an &#8220;intimate&#8221; alternative to the large commercial movie houses of the day.

Located in Paris, the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que offers daily screenings of films from around the world.<\/p>\n<p>The collection emerged from the efforts of Henri Langlois in the 1930s to collect and screen films. Langlois had acquired one of the largest collections in the world by the beginning of World War II, only to have it nearly wiped out by the German authorities in occupied France, who ordered the destruction of all films made prior to 1937. He and his friends smuggled huge numbers of documents and films out of occupied France to protect them until the end of the war.<br \/>\nAfter the war, the French government provided a small screening room, staff and subsidy for the collection, which was first relocated to the Avenue de Messine. Significant French filmmakers of the 1940s and 1950s, including Robert Bresson, Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment, Henri-Georges Clouzot and Jacques Becker frequented screenings at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que. Directors of the New Wave (la Nouvelle Vague) school \u2014 Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Roger Vadim, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Pierre Kast \u2014 also received much of their film education by attending the collection&#8217;s screenings.<\/p>\n<p>After numerous incidents \u2014 including multiple relocations from one small screening room to another through the 1950s and a fire in its last premises \u2014 the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise moved to 51, rue de Bercy in the 12th arrondissement of Paris and reopened its doors in a postmodern building designed by Frank Gehry, an American architect. A restaurant on the lower level is open to the public.<br \/>\nThe Biblioth\u00e8que du Film, which was created in 1992 to show the history of cinema, its production, impact and artistic strength, has recently merged with the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise.<\/p>\n<p>51 Rue de Bercy<br \/>\n75012 Paris, France<br \/>\n33 1 71 19 33 33<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinematheque.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise (French pronunciation: \u200b[sinemat\u025bk f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025bz]) holds one of the largest archives of films, movie documents and film-related objects in the world.

In 1977 the theater closed for several years and an attempt was made to &#8220;modernize&#8221; the building in 1978 with the application of stucco. In the early 1980s the movie theater shut down, and the acting group River City Playhouse moved into the space in 1984. In 1991 the building was remodeled into a nightclub, Club 5, which closed in 2004.<\/p>\n<p>A four year, $4.5 million historic restoration was begun in 2004 after local car dealer Mike Shad purchased the property. Midway through the renovations, the facility was opened for private events like reunions and wedding receptions, but work was not completed until 2008. The renamed 5 Points Theatre and Historic Event Facility now offers 14 loft condominiums on the third and fourth floors, commercial\/office space on the second level and retail space on the ground floor, in addition to the theater. Although the marquee was not original, it was also restored because it is considered a historic component. In 2010 the Theatre shifted to an &#8220;art house&#8221; format, with foreign, independent and classic films, late night movies, and special events and concerts. <\/p>\n<p>1028 Park St<br \/>\nJacksonville, FL 32204<br \/>\n(904) 359-0049<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sunraycinema.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sun-Ray Cinema<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Sun-Ray Cinema at 5 Points, formerly known as Riverside Theater and 5 Points Theatre, is a historic single-screen movie theater in Jacksonville, Florida.

In the late 1950s, the space was converted into a movie theater, with several incarnations. These include: The New Yorker Theater, the Europa (specializing in foreign films), the Eros (pornographic films) and finally the Beverly Cinema, a grindhouse which incorporated live nude dancing.<\/p>\n<p>The theater was closed in September 1977, and changed management months later. On May 5, 1978, The Beverly Cinema debuted a new programming format with a double feature of A Streetcar Named Desire and Last Tango in Paris. Since that time, the theater has run a continuous series of double features, comprising modern and classic films in a wide variety of genres. It is the last continuous repertory revival house in Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>In December 2007, to save the property from redevelopment, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino bought the building that houses the New Beverly Cinema, effectively making him the theater&#8217;s landlord. In September 2014, seven years after acquiring the theater, Quentin Tarantino took over the programming duties. The cinema will continue showing double features exclusively in 35mm (or 16mm, depending on print availability).

Rather than succumbing to the wrecker\u2019s ball, The State experienced a metamorphosis from a movie theater to a performing arts venue and community center. Over the years there have been remodels, changing owners, various governing boards, a stint as Cine Mexico, and perhaps most notable and remarkable- its complete renovation six years ago under new ownership, a nonprofit corporation. The renovation was managed by the Modesto Symphony who asked local designer, Michelle Lacy, ASID, CID, to submit her \u201cvision\u201d of a renovated State Theatre. Ms. Lacy had her hand in nearly every aspect of the design and renovation, from the silver-leafed, grand dome ceiling in the lobby and faux-painted walls \u2013 courtesy of Rhonda McDonald and Sue Oler, ofRhonda and Sue Wall Design \u2013 to the dramatic chandelier that presides over the foyer and ushers movie and concert goers into the lobby. Of course there were many more inspirations that followed in what became a year and half long project that Ms. Lacy regards as possibly the pinnacle of her professional career.There were many behind-the-scenes changes as well, including the installation of a state-of-the-art surround sound system by Meyer Sound, whose products are used in Carnegie Hall and the Royal Albert Hall. A $20,000 movie screen was also installed since film is still the focal point of the theater\u2019s vibrant, year-round programming. The project, expertly guided by Guy Simile of Simile Construction, became for all involved a glorious tribute to the community, one Modesto residents will be proud of for decades to come.<\/p>\n<p>With its new facade, sound system, marquee and lobby, The State Theatre now rivals its more modern counterparts in luxury and modern conveniences. But step into the house -the 570-seat auditorium- and you quickly realize, there&#8217;s no other place in Modesto like it. The Art Deco-era splendor, as designed by noted architect S. Charles Lee (1899-1990), still remains. The towering sconces, the larger-than-life, gold-leafed embellishments throughout, the hand-painted murals, are all decorative elements dating from 1934 when the theater was presented on Christmas Day to an appreciative, rural community drawn to the glamour, excitement and escape only Hollywood movies could provide. Flirtation Walk, starring Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, drew crowds to what was described as a 21-gun salute to youth and gallantry, the big screen\u2019s first military musical, and to the newest theater in town, a marvel of Art Deco design constructed at a cost of $100,000 by local builder Harry Brown.<\/p>\n<p>The State\u2019s designer, a Chicago-born architect and early proponent of Art Deco and Moderne style theaters, went on to become recognized as one of the most prolific and distinguished motion picture theater designers on the West Coast. After moving to Los Angeles in1922, his first major movie palace was the Tower Theatre, a Spanish-Romanesque-Moorish design that launched a career that would make Lee the principal designer of motion picture theaters in Los Angeles during the 1930s and 1940s. He is credited with designing over 400 theaters throughout California and Mexico, including The State and Fresno\u2019s Tower Theatre (1939). His palatial and Baroque Los Angeles Theatre is regarded by many architectural historians as the finest theater building in L.A. Lee\u2019s unofficial motto was \u201cThe Show Starts on The Sidewalk,\u201d a theme that was carried throughout The State with its Deco-inspired adornments and murals that were very much \u201cof the period.\u201d Admission was 25 cents and air conditioning \u2013 a welcome novelty in a farming town situated in the sun-drenched Central Valley \u2013 was a major selling point for the city\u2019s newest movie and certainly most modern movie palace. The State\u2019s governing body continually searches for ways to keep the theater relevant, its programming fresh and its films a reflection of the industry\u2019s most thoughtful \u2013 and thought-provoking \u2013 work. Most recently, The State made the leap to the high-definition, digital presentation of films. The 35mm projectors remain for classic films and use by the Modesto Film Society, but a hard drive and a server have replaced the multiple reels that arrive in oversize canisters and projectionists are no longer threading miles of film but work on a computer instead. There are always changes afoot at The State, but 79 years after its opening, a few things remain the same: hospitality is key and audiences still thrill to the splendor of an Art Deco theater with one foot firmly planted in Modesto\u2019s history, and the other pointed squarely toward her future.<\/p>\n<p>1307 J St<br \/>\nModesto, CA 95354<br \/>\n209-527-4697<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thestate.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">The State Theatre<\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The mission of the nonprofit State Theatre is to preserve and operate Modesto\u2019s only remaining historic theater, and to engage the community through a broad, diverse and inclusive array of films, performing arts and social, civic and educational events.

The roots of this successful programming can be traced back to an opportunistic partnership born in 1976, which eventually led to city-wide events and initiatives that are still active today.<\/p>\n<p>Looking back, the early 1970\u2019s proved a tumultuous time in IHP\u2019s past. Due to an inability to reach full occupancy of the 450 available rooms, the high cost of heating and cooling the enormous facilities of the new building, and a revolving door of administrative staff, it seemed as if IHP had overestimated its ability to fulfill the financial obligations of the new building. Fortunately, with an active, caring, and involved Board that refused to give up the nearly 75-year-old institution and the good fortune of having Program Director (and later President) Ellen Davis on staff, IHP was able to gain financial and public footing once again. In 1976, Ms. Davis made the bold move to donate IHP building space to the established Neighborhood Film Project (previously of the Christian Association) and the Folklife Center of Philadelphia, under the condition that they split the profits from ticket sales for events held in the International House facilities. This tactful decision allowed International House to develop unique public programming that engaged not only an international audience, but a community audience as well. The partnership helped to cultivate respect and reverence locally, and led to increased funding for further development and programming. Three years later, in 1979, the Neighborhood Film and Video Project and International House Philadelphia merged, preceding fantastically successful programs that allowed for greatly needed projects and facility upgrades. This newfound artistic identity within Greater Philadelphia, and expansion on a legacy of goodwill, is what continues to set IHP apart from other International Houses throughout the world.<\/p>\n<p>The Ibrahim Theater is a fully-equipped, multi-purpose theater facility that seats up to 360 people. Featuring a state-of-the-art concert sound-system, the theater can accommodate a variety of music presentations from small acoustic ensembles to fully amplified 10+ piece bands. The Ibrahim Theater is also ideal for film and video screenings, with the capability to project 16mm and 35mm film as well as most video formats including DCP, Blu-ray, DVD, DigiBeta, BetaSP, MiniDV, and VHS video formats.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">3701 Chestnut St<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Philadelphia, PA 19104<br \/>\n(215) 387-5125<\/span><\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/ihousephilly.org\/<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The IHP programming of today and recent history is best known for its world-class international, avant-garde, and repertory cinema, as well as documentaries and lectures that seek to increase awareness on important global issues in the arts and humanities.

At first we had only one 90-seat screen (now Cinema 2), accessed via a back door on Chuckie Pend, off Morrison Street, but by 1985 the restoration work was complete, and Cinema 1, the bar and the front doors were opened. Cinema 3 was added in 1997.<\/p>\n<p>Filmhouse&#8217;s programme includes around 700 films and events every year, and we can screen work digitally (in 2D and Active 3D) and from film, be it 35mm, 16mm or even 70mm. We frequently host Q&amp;As and panel discussions, and our Education and Learning department offers a range of screenings, workshops, courses and events for all ages. All three cinemas are fully accessible, and we regularly screen films with audio description and hard-of-hearing subtitles. In 2012 we received a Go Shop Award from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, in recognition of our good practice.<\/p>\n<p>As well as our three screens, we have a comfortable caf\u00e9 bar, offering a wide range of freshly-prepared food, including vegetarian and award-winning vegan options, and a great selection of ales and wines. Drinks can be taken into the cinemas &#8211; just ask for a plastic glass!<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, Filmhouse has had hundreds of special guests at its screenings and other events, including the likes of Andrei Tarkovsky, Michael Powell, Martin Scorsese, Richard Attenborough, Sean Connery, James Mason, Derek Jarman, Kenneth Anger, Tom Stoppard, Jimmy Cliff, Ian Dury, Kenneth Branagh, Terence Stamp and Francesco Rosi. Amongst those we were privileged to welcome here in 2013 were Andrei Konchalovsky, Borgen&#8217;s Sidse Babett Knudsen, Monika Treut and J\u00f6rn Donner. In 2014, Bill Forsyth and musician Edwyn Collins were in attendance for Q&amp;As at sold-out screenings, and queues formed up Lothian Road when Russell Crowe made a special appearance as Filmhouse played host to the Scottish premiere of Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s Noah.<\/p>\n<p>Filmhouse has also branched out into the world of video on demand, with a range of specially selected films available via the Filmhouse Player. And, May 2013, it lauched Filmhouse Distribution, with releases to date including Alexey Balabanov&#8217;s The Stoker and Victor Kossakovsky&#8217;s \u00a1Vivan Las Antipodas!. Its newest release, the luminously beautiful documentary My Name Is Salt, will open in cinemas nationwide on Fri 13 Mar.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, Filmhouse undertook two major new screening projects. The Cinema of Childhood, an ambitious season of 17 films from 12 different countries, was launched in April and the films have since had over 450 screenings across 56 separate UK venues. We also began our ongoing First World War in Cinema season, which will screen a wide range of films over four years, each tied to the ongoing centenary of the 1914-1918 conflict.<\/p>\n<p>Since its inception, Filmhouse has been the home of the Edinburgh International Film Festival and has been host to many fantastic screenings and events as part of the festival. The two organisations have always worked closely together, and this arrangement was formalised in 2010 with the formation of the Centre for the Moving Image (CMI), a registered charity which incorporates Filmhouse and EIFF. From 4 Apr 2014, the CMI has also been very proud to operate the Belmont Filmhouse in Aberdeen.<\/p>\n<p>Filmhouse receives funding from Creative Scotland, Europa Cinemas, City of Edinburgh Council and the British Film Institute.<\/p>\n<p>88 Lothian Rd<br \/>\nEdinburgh EH3 9BZ<br \/>\nUnited Kingdom<br \/>\n+44 131 228 2688<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.filmhousecinema.com\/\">Filmhouse Cinema <\/a><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Filmhouse is a world-class, three-screen independent cinema showing a wide range of films from all over the world, from quality crowd-pleasers and family films to esoteric arthouse works, via restored classics, retrospectives and themed seasons and festivals.

The Hollywood&#8217;s popular 35mm series include Cinema Classics, Kung Fu Theater and monthly Grindhouse screenings, and they are the only 70mm theater in the state of Oregon.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday, July 17, 1926. at 2:00 pm, the Hollywood Theatre opened its curtains for the first time, presenting <em>More Pay \u2013 Less Work<\/em>. \u00a0 It was a momentous occasion \u2013 for the city and for the neighborhood, which then became known as Hollywood.<\/p>\n<p>When the 1,500-seat Hollywood Theatre first opened, a local advertisement called it a \u201cpalace of luxury, comfort and entertainment unsurpassed by any theatre on the Coast.\u201d The Hollywood was the last venue in Portland built as both a vaudeville house and a movie theatre. Though sound was not fully introduced until 1927, there was plenty of lively sound in the place \u2013 provided by performers of all kinds, plus an eight-piece orchestra and organist.<\/p>\n<p>Designed by Bennes &amp; Herzog architects of Portland, the Hollywood is Spanish Colonial Revival in style. At the time, it was similar in style to some theatres, but different in its location. Most movie palaces were located in downtown areas. The Hollywood was built in an outer neighborhood on Sandy Blvd., with good streetcar and automobile access. It was a popular destination in Portland.<\/p>\n<p>As decades rolled on, the Hollywood kept changing with the times. In the early 1960s the Theatre became the first Cinerama facility in the Pacific Northwest. The ultra-widescreen film format required the addition of two projection booths and a huge wrap-around screen.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; See more at: http:\/\/hollywoodtheatre.org\/about\/mission-history\/#sthash.p3RHU6JA.dpuf<\/p>\n<p>In 1975, walls and projection booths were built to divide the Theatre\u2019s balcony and create three separate auditorium spaces. The Theatre currently includes a 384-seat main auditorium (the original orchestra), a 114-seat venue (one-half of the original balcony), and a 111-seat venue (the other half of the original balcony). All three venues are capable of screening films.<\/p>\n<p>Although attention was brought to the Theatre when it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, the Hollywood had become an old dame over the years. It had fallen on hard times and operated as a second-run discount movie house. Fortunately, the sad story took a turn in the late 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>In 1997, the non-profit Film Action Oregon (FAO) acted to preserve an important part of Oregon\u2019s cultural history and purchased the Hollywood Theatre. FAO realized the essential role the Theatre plays in the Northeast Portland community. They began to transform the neglected theatre into the local treasure it once was. In 2011, the non-profit dropped the name Film Action Oregon, and now is just known as the Hollywood Theatre. The name lives on and so does its legacy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/35mmforever.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/early-hollywood-theatre-photo-1926.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-181\" src=\"http:\/\/35mmforever.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/early-hollywood-theatre-photo-1926.jpg\" alt=\"early-hollywood-theatre-photo-1926\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/35mmforever.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/early-hollywood-theatre-photo-1926.jpg 640w, http:\/\/35mmforever.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/early-hollywood-theatre-photo-1926-620x465.jpg 620w, http:\/\/35mmforever.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/early-hollywood-theatre-photo-1926-150x113.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>4122 NE Sandy Boulevard<br \/>\nPortland, OR 97212<br \/>\n(503) 281-4215<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodtheatre.org\" target=\"_blank\">Hollywood Theatre<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Hollywood Theatre is a historic, non-profit theater that runs a mixture of first run, repertory and special event screenings.
